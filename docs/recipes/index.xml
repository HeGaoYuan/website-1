User can modify the code, reference the code repository and run the jobs without re-building the image every time to include the modified code.
Currently, only support downloading from github. The implementation is pluggable and can easily support other distributed filesystem like HDFS.
Git Hub Users can set the git config in the job&amp;rsquo;s annotation with key kubedl.io/git-sync-config as below. The git repo will be downloaded and saved in the container&amp;rsquo;s working dir by default.</description></item><item><title>Host Network</title><link>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/hostnetwork/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 19:32:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/hostnetwork/</guid><description>Background Network bandwidth is a bottleneck resource for communication-intensive jobs. However, native container network model causes a loss to network performance, hostnetwork is an available solution to address this. In addition, other scenarios (e.g: nvlink communications between containerized gpu processes) may depend on host-network as well.
How To Use KubeDL provide a feature-gate to enable hostnetwork mode for jobs, users only need to add an annotation kubedl.io/network-mode: host to job specifications, for example:</description></item><item><title>Metadata/Events Persistency</title><link>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/persistency/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:35:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/persistency/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tensorboard</title><link>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/tensorboard/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:35:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kubedl.io/docs/recipes/tensorboard/</guid><description>KubeDL can attach a tensorboard to a running tensorflow job. Users can measure and visualize the tensorflow job with the tensorboard.
To use tensorboard, users must ensure that the tensorflow job logs are created and stored in a kubernetes volume(emptyDir hostPath and local are not supported), and the tensorboard can reuse the volume.
Users can set the tensorboard config in the job&amp;rsquo;s annotation with key kubedl.io/tensorboard-config as below. After that, users can access the tensorboard through this URL http://&amp;lt;ingress host&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ingress pathPrefix&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;job namespace&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;job name&amp;gt;.</description></item></channel></rss>
